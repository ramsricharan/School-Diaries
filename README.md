## About Project
The main use case of our application is in daycares are preschools. At that stage kids a too young to be able 
to communicate everything that goes on in their class, but parent want to be updated on everything that goes 
on in the class. And other solutions like, teacher talking to parents to give updates is not instant and not 
practical to talk to every single parent every day. This app connects teacher with all the parents at the same 
time. Makes a world of difference for the parent who can stay updated on everything their child is doing at that 
moment and also for the teacher to organize, keep track of all the activities and last but not least communicate 
with all parents easily.
